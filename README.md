Assignment 9

Welcome to Github! Github is a way to store and share code. Because we have three files having three different pastebins is a mess.

I'll commit to this often so just hit that 'zip' button above to get the latest code. 

Note: Please don't look at my other repos here, none of it is c so you won't get it...

Regards,
Niall
